# EXPERIENCE		

## SOFTWARE ENGINEER 1, SIEMENS HEALTHINEERS
### September 2016 –  Current
- Architected and developed a framework for control systems used in tabletop blood-gas machines using C++ on the QNX Neutrino RTOS
- Collaborated with other engineers to create a reusable embedded software architecture in C++ that will be used for the next 20+ years on Siemens products   
- Designed and programmed a process within the architecture that enables biomedical engineers to use the aforementioned framework to create procedures and define responses to real-time events in the  blood-gas machine
- Wrote unit tests for the embedded system using internal unit test tools

## ENGINEERING INTERN, VETTER SOFTWARE
### June 2015 – August 2015
- Created data pipelining software that streams data from veterinary lab equipment to cloud-based practice management software with Java and Bash Scripting
- Used built-in Java Swing to create a GUI for the software
- Software deployed to 400+ veterinary clinics around the United States

# EDUCATION		

## USC VITERBI SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING 
### B.S. COMPUTER SCIENCE, CLASS OF 2016
## RELEVANT COURSEWORK:
###	CSCI 401: Design and Construction of Large Software Systems
- Used C, Linux, and Raspberry Pi hardware to intercept and decode UDP and TCP packets sent from DJI Phantom drones to their controllers
- Awarded Honorable Mention from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine for the 2016 University Design Competition for Addressing Airport Needs

###	CSCI 350: Intro to Operating Systems
- Built essential functionality, including threading, syscalls, and virtual memory into the NachOS operating system in C and C++
- Implemented a distributed operating system with NachOS that can run on up to 5 different machines at once, enabling applications to use multiple machine resources

###	CSCI 445: Robotics
- Used a Raspberry Pi, two servo motors, a sonar set, and a digital camera to create an autonomous, self-driving robot 
- OpenCV was used to distinguish objects based on color and shape
- Sonars on the robot were used to create a PID controller using C++
